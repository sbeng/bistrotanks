Bistrotanks
====================


Basic 2D multiplayer deathmatch game
---------------------

The main purpose of this project was to try and learn something about Erlang, so don't expect excellent code quality and design decisions :D

### How to compile and run

0. Make sure that you have latest version of Erlang/OTP installed. I used Erlang/OTP 18.3
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies and compile: `make`
3. Run: `_rel/bistrotanks/bin/bistrotanks foreground`
4. Server listens to `localhost:8080`
